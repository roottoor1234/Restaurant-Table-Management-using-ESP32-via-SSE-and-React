# Restaurant-Table-Management-using-ESP32-via-SSE-and-React
We are on a restaurant and we see a gadget on a table. This gadget has a button and when we press it, sends a message on localhost backend and our frontend table management system receives the message and can manage which table called for a waiter.

Hey and welcome to my project.

This project is a compination of 3D DIY Modelling-Printing, Arduino-Esp32, ExpressJS using Technology of SSE as Backend and React as Frontend.
We need esp32 in deepsleep mode for power economy.


STEPS: 


1) First of all, you can 3d print the cases ( if you want ).
2) Send the code to esp32.
     Dont forget to replace some constants inside.
3) Npm install in every folder
   Done!!!

You have the option with electron also to make it a desktop app.

Thank you very much,
Enjoy!
